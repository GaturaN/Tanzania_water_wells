Tanzania Water Wells Project

Tanzania is a developing country with a population of over 59 million citizens. It is faced with a challenge of having to provide clean and drinkable water to th epopulation. To try and curb this, many water wells have been dug over the years. This project will try to understand and predict the functional pumps, pumps that need some repair, and pumps that do not work at all. We will make use of original data obtained by the [DrivenData 'Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table' competition](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/page/25/).


The goal in this project is to build a model that predicts the functionality of water points. With this predictive model, authorities can understand which water points are functional, nonfunctional, and functional but it needs to repair. 


With 86% accuracy, our model can predict the functionality of wells. With the good prediction of functionality, the solutions can be;

- prioritizing functioning wells which need repair and yield clean water
- targeting repairs to clusters of wells especially those with high populations
- payments of some kind will provide an incentive to keep wells functional
- allocate funds and resources to effective organizations with a track record
